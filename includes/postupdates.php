          JMF 2.1 is the latest version, and that was released a long time ago. JMF will probably not support all codec formats. That is probably why you are not able to play the file. There are also a lot of codec licensing issues.

          There is a JMF performance pack for windows & *nix which will support more codecs than the default installation. Try that. If that doesn't work take a look at ffmpeg or VLC-J.
